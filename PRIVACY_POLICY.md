# Privacy Policy

## 1. General Information

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Mathematical Examples Trainer"
web application processes data.

The application was developed by Oleksandr Romanets as part of the
university course "Component-Oriented Programming (КОП)".

The application operates entirely in the user's browser and is intended
for educational purposes only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Data Processing

### 2.1 No Personal Data Collection

The application:

-   Does not collect personal data such as name, email address, phone
    number, or geolocation.
-   Does not transmit any information to external servers.
-   Does not use analytics, tracking systems, or third-party advertising
    tools.

All functionality runs locally within the user's browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Local Storage Usage

The application uses the browser's localStorage mechanism to enhance
user experience and preserve progress.

The following data is stored locally:

### 3.1 User Identifier

A randomly generated UUID is stored under the key:

uuid

This identifier:

-   Is generated locally in the browser
-   Is not linked to any personal information
-   Is not transmitted outside the device

### 3.2 Difficulty Settings

The selected difficulty level is stored under the keys:

difficult difficulty

This allows the application to remember the user's preferred level
(easy, medium, hard).

### 3.3 Game Statistics

Game results are stored under a key structured as:

{uuid}\_gameSave

This object may include:

-   lastGameCorrectAnswers
-   correctAnswers
-   totalTasks
-   totalGames

These statistics are stored locally to provide cumulative results and
user progress tracking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Cookies

The application may use a technical storage entry to remember user
preferences or consent settings.

The application:

-   Does not use advertising cookies
-   Does not use third-party cookies
-   Does not perform behavioral tracking

All stored information remains within the user's browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Data Control and User Rights

Since no personal data is collected or processed externally:

-   Users may delete all stored information at any time by clearing
    browser storage.
-   Users may disable local storage in browser settings.
-   Users retain full control over all locally stored data.

Under GDPR principles, the user has full control over their data stored
on their own device.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if new features are added that
involve additional data processing.
